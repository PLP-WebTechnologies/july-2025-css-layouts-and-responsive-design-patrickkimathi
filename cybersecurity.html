      <h3>What is Cybersecurity?</h3>
      <p>
        Cybersecurity is the practice of defending computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems,
        networks, and data from malicious attacks. It is also known as information technology security 
        or electronic information security.
      </p>
      <p>
        As businesses, governments, and individuals rely more heavily on technology, the importance of 
        cybersecurity has skyrocketed. Without it, personal data, financial records, and even 
        national infrastructure could be at risk of being compromised.

    <!-- Types of Threats -->
    <section class="card">
      <h3>Types of Cyber Threats</h3>
      <p><strong>Malware:</strong> Malicious software such as viruses, worms, or trojans designed to damage or disrupt systems.</p>
      <p><strong>Phishing:</strong> Fraudulent attempts to trick users into sharing sensitive information through fake emails or websites.</p>
      <p><strong>Ransomware:</strong> Software that locks users out of their systems or files until a ransom is paid.</p>
      <p><strong>Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks:</strong> Flooding systems with traffic to make them unavailable.</p>
      <p><strong>Insider Threats:</strong> Employees or contractors who misuse their access to harm the organization.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Technologies -->
    <section class="card">
      <h3>Key Cybersecurity Technologies</h3>
      <p><strong>Zero Trust Architecture:</strong> A security model that requires verification from every user and device, regardless of location.</p>
      <p><strong>AI-Powered Threat Detection:</strong> Systems that monitor and analyze behavior to detect attacks in real time.</p>
      <p><strong>Biometric Authentication:</strong> Fingerprint scans, facial recognition, and iris scans to ensure secure access.</p>
      <p><strong>Encryption:</strong> Encoding sensitive data to keep it secure during storage and transmission.</p>
      <p><strong>Cloud Security:</strong> Tools and practices to protect data hosted in cloud services.</p>

    <!-- Careers -->
    <section class="card">
      <h3>Careers in Cybersecurity</h3>
      <p>
        With the rise of digital threats, cybersecurity professionals are in high demand across 
        industries. Careers range from technical roles like <strong>penetration testers</strong> 
        and <strong>security analysts</strong> to leadership positions such as 
        <strong>Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Common career paths include:
        <ul>
          <li>Network Security Engineer</li>
          <li>Incident Response Specialist</li>
          <li>Cloud Security Architect</li>
          <li>Ethical Hacker / Pen Tester</li>
        </ul>

    <!-- Future -->
    <section class="card">
      <h3>The Future of Cybersecurity</h3>
      <p>
        As technology evolves, so do cyber threats. Emerging trends include the use of 
        <strong>quantum computing</strong>, which could both break current encryption 
        and create new, more secure cryptographic methods.
      </p>
      <p>
        The integration of AI with cybersecurity is expected to grow, enabling systems 
        that can automatically detect, predict, and neutralize threats with minimal 
        human intervention. This will transform how organizations defend themselves 
        against increasingly complex attacks.
      </p>
      <p>
        The future of cybersecurity will also focus on privacy, ethics, and international 
        collaboration to protect users worldwide.
