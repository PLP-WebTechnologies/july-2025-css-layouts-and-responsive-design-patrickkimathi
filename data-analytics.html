    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      Data analytics is the science of examining raw data to uncover patterns, 
      trends, and insights that can drive smarter decision-making. With the explosion 
      of digital information, organizations now rely on analytics as a foundation for 
      innovation and competitiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
      From business intelligence dashboards to predictive modeling, data analytics 
      enables companies to move beyond intuition and base their strategies on 
      evidence. This transition toward data-driven cultures is reshaping industries.

    <h3>Applications</h3>
    <p>
      In healthcare, analytics helps predict disease outbreaks, optimize treatment 
      plans, and improve patient care. In finance, it supports fraud detection and 
      portfolio management. Governments use data to guide policy-making and deliver 
      public services more effectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Advanced analytics, such as machine learning and big data processing, 
      further expand possibilities by enabling automation and predictive insights 
      at unprecedented scales.

    <h3>Future of Data Analytics</h3>
    <p>
      As organizations collect ever-growing volumes of information, the need for 
      efficient, ethical, and secure data management becomes critical. The future 
      lies in real-time analytics, cloud-native platforms, and stronger integration 
      with artificial intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ultimately, data analytics will not just describe the past but anticipate the 
      future, empowering industries to act proactively rather than reactively.
